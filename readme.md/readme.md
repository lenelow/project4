For this project I create a mobile app for fans of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. The app uses an api to gather information about this fictional world in a way that is easily digestible for users. I used React Native, Redux, axios, and react-navigation to build this project. As of now, you can view all of the families, and link to each individual family. You can also use view the characters, but you cannot yet link to any individual character. This is because I originally wanted to make the characters accessibly through an individual family, not an index of characters. But the structure of the API made this diffictul, so I am temporarily doing it this way. I don't think it will be hard to make individual characters accessible via the character index, I just didn't end up having time. Styling was interesting because it is very different from CSS, but it was also very difficult. I added pagination to make navigating through the lists of characters and families easier, which was also very difficult. I am excited to continue working on this project.
