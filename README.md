# project4 ASOIAF: A Searchable Overview Involving All Families

For our final project, we were able to use any technology we wanted, even those we hadn't learned in class. Althought I was originally considering creating something using Python and Django, I decided instead to teach myself something completely new, and build a front-end app in React-Native. The application is called ASOIAF: A Searchable Overview Involving All Families. I was made for fans of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" (aka ASOIAF) books, to help people navigate the complicated relationships between and amongst the characters and their families. Exploring mobile development was pretty difficult but also a lot of fun. This project also needs some work done before it is finished, and it has not yet been deployed. The navigation is unfinished, and the purpose of this app is navigating character relationships. I also need to do more styling, and I may want to create a database of my own, as oppose dot using an API.
